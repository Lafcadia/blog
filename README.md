# History of the Blog

## Around 2019 https://zzxdzld.github.io

In 2019 I used GitHub Pages to launch my very first website, which is very primitive and only contains one HTML file. I was still a pupil.

I forgot what I put on it, presumably something like [Du](https://github.com/Lafcadia/Du).

## 2022 https://chuishen.cf

It's a brand new start.

I tried to start creative writing which was unsuccessful but spiritually inspiring. The main body of work of that period is Silver Tree Romance (a sci-fi novella, not done) and Construction At 13.

## 2023 https://chuishen.xyz (current blog)

Using a paid domain does not only mean that I'm more serious about the blog this time but also indicates that I am back in the development field. Also, this blog witnesses the creation of [Team OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean).
